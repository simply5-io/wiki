## **Install OpenVPN for Debian**

### **1. Run as superuser**

`su`

### **2. Download components**

```basic
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get install curl openvpn unzip
```

### **3. Download the configuration file**

Move the downloaded .ovpn file to OpenVPN folder

### **4. Enter your login credentials**

```basic
echo "**CHANGE TO YOUR USERNAME**" >> /etc/openvpn/credentials

```

### **5. Start OpenVPN and see that everything works**

```basic
openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/clroom.conf --daemon

### **6. Verify that the connection was successful**

Wait for about a minute after running the last command, then run:

:::note
The service you should check is openvpn@NAME where NAME is the name of your configuration file (without the **".conf"**). So if your openvpn configuration file is /etc/openvpn/**clroom**.conf you should use command as below.
:::

```basic
systemctl status openvpn@clroom

```

```basic
openvpn@clroom.service - OpenVPN connection to clroom
