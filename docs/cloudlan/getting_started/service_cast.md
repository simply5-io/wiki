## **Introduction**
**Service casting** feature is built to provide a seamless and simplified way to use your machine as hosting server to improve productivity of the developer and professional teams working remote.

:::note
This feature is for **development use only**, where you need to quickly showcase your work for someone else to consume or expose your service as webhook end points
:::

### Key concepts in Service casting

1. **Adding a service**
    Add Application, API gateway, Website or Webhook running on your local machine
    - **Name** - This is used to identify what is been casted
    - **Port** & **slug** - The port on your machine the said service is running on, you can also add a slug if needed 
    - Click **Add service** 
    
2. **Adding a folder**  
    If you would like to share a files with your team, you can quickly share by following steps
     - Give a **name**
     - Input a free **port** on your machine which will be used to host a temporary FTP server by CloudLAN app
     - Click '**+ Folder**' & **select a Folder** you would like to cast
3. **Casting Options** <br />
    Once the services are added, you have following options to start casting
    - **TeamURL -**  If you want to cast this servcie only to your team connected to the room
    - **PublicURL -** If you want anyone on the internet to access the service, works great when working with Webhooks, 

:::note 
- Any request on these URL's will be directly forwarded to your local machine through internet NAT
- **PublicURL** remains static till you remove the cast so you can use this as end point in app developement
