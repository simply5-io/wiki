CloudLAN is a secure, managed and virtualized networking platform that enables people to work from anywhere – literally. Delivered via the cloud, CloudLAN eliminates the cost, complexity and management of remote network connections. It allows you to implement a cost effective resilient network solution in Minutes instead of Hours or Days.

At the heart of CloudLAN is a powerful virtual gateway technology, which provides you with a seamless federation, management and authentication service. You can add and manage users and devices connecting from anywhere in the world without the need for servers or proprietary hardware. CloudLAN ensures that you will never have to worry about IT administration for your remote workers again.
