 Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a method of verifying your identity that adds an extra layer of security to your account passwords.
 With 2-FA Enabled, your account needs more than just the username and password credentials to login your account, so that hackers may not be able to crack as easily.<br/>

 You may require to enter **TOTP** generated by scanning the QR-Code from account page using Authy or Google Authenticator app installed on your Smart phone/Tablet to **Enable 2-Factor Authentication.**  <br/>

 On enabling 2-FA, set of 2-FA Codes will be displayed. Copy those codes in the safest space of your choice. <br/> A single 2-FA code can be used for only one time login with your correct credentials.

:::note
 Remember that nothing is 100% secure, and even 2FA can be vulnerable to hackers. If a hacker gains access to the email account associated with your 2FA information, they could reset your password by selecting ***“Forgot password”*** on login page. This password recovery option could completely bypass your 2FA and allow the hacker to create a new password, locking you out of your account. <br/> 

 ***Be sure to monitor your email account for messages requesting password changes.***
